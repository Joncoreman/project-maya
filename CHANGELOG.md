# Changelog

Every release is on GitHub (Releases) with these notes. Update: `git pull`, then `./setup.sh` (Windows:
`START-MAYA.bat`) - it recompiles only what changed and starts.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-10-07

- **Windows (experimental):** `START-MAYA.bat` sets Maya up the way `./maya.sh` does on Linux - Python, the
  engine and the image encoder compiled with Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools and CUDA 12.8, the model download, the
  dashboard. The engine reads the model's experts with unbuffered parallel reads and sizes its pinned RAM to what
  Windows allows (RAM + page file). It compiles on Windows; it has not been run on a Windows PC with an NVIDIA GPU
  yet - tell us how it runs. See README > Windows.
- **Fix:** a second GPU big enough to hold all of its experts (e.g. 64 GB cards) stopped the start with "the pinned
  RAM tier did not allocate".
- **Fix:** temperature 0 is greedy and deterministic again.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-10-07

The first release.

- **Maya-S** (96.5 GB): Project Maya's compact quant of GLM-5.3-Flash, made from Z.ai's FP8 release. It keeps
  97.9% of the FP8 model's zero-shot accuracy (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, PIQA).
- The engine: the model's experts tiered across VRAM, pinned RAM and the SSD, one GPU or two that share the layers,
  MTP speculative decoding, a thinking budget, images on demand.
- The installer (`./setup.sh`), the dashboard and the OpenAI / Anthropic compatible API.
