# Changelog

Every release is on GitHub (Releases) with these notes. Update: `git pull`, then `./setup.sh` (Windows:
`START-MAYA.bat`) - it recompiles only what changed and starts.

## v1.2.1 - 2026-10-07

A one-command report for problems and speeds: `./maya.sh --report` (Windows: `START-MAYA.bat --report`).

- **`--report`** writes `maya-report.txt` in the Maya folder: your GPUs (VRAM, driver, PCIe link), CPU, RAM, disks,
  your Maya setup (model, context, GPUs) and the engine log's speed lines - how the model is split across VRAM, RAM and
  the SSD, and where each token's time goes. Attach it when you report a problem or a speed, so the engine can be
  tuned for your machine. Nothing is sent anywhere; your home folder shows as `~` and no API key is included.

## v1.2.0 - 2026-10-07

Faster prefill (how fast Maya reads your prompt): up to 46% on two GPUs and up to 2x on one.

- **Prefill speed:** the experts a prompt needs that are neither in VRAM nor in RAM are read from the SSD ahead of
  time into a deeper buffer (the reader was keeping the NVMe at about a quarter of its speed), the next layer's
  experts are read while the current one computes, and the prompt is cut into bigger pieces on bigger cards (fewer
  times every expert is fetched). Prefill measured on 2x Tesla V100 32 GB with 30 GB RAM, prompts of 2k / 8k / 16k /
  30k tokens: 240 / 331 / 345 / - -> 273 / 428 / 487 / 506 tokens/s. On one of those GPUs: prefill of an 8k-token
  prompt 115 -> 226 tokens/s. Answers are unchanged in quality (the same text, up to rounding).
- **Support Project Maya:** [buymeacoffee.com/peasantsmith](https://buymeacoffee.com/peasantsmith) (README, and the
  Sponsor button on GitHub).
- README: how Maya grew out of Strata; exported chats are named `maya-chat-*.md`.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-10-07

- **Windows (experimental):** `START-MAYA.bat` sets Maya up the way `./maya.sh` does on Linux - Python, the
  engine and the image encoder compiled with Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools and CUDA 12.8, the model download, the
  dashboard. The engine reads the model's experts with unbuffered parallel reads and sizes its pinned RAM to what
  Windows allows (RAM + page file). It compiles on Windows; it has not been run on a Windows PC with an NVIDIA GPU
  yet - tell us how it runs. See README > Windows.
- **Fix:** a second GPU big enough to hold all of its experts (e.g. 64 GB cards) stopped the start with "the pinned
  RAM tier did not allocate".
- **Fix:** temperature 0 is greedy and deterministic again.

## v1.0.0 - 2026-10-07

The first release.

- **Maya-S** (96.5 GB): Project Maya's compact quant of GLM-5.3-Flash, made from Z.ai's FP8 release. It keeps
  97.9% of the FP8 model's zero-shot accuracy (ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, PIQA).
- The engine: the model's experts tiered across VRAM, pinned RAM and the SSD, one GPU or two that share the layers,
  MTP speculative decoding, a thinking budget, images on demand.
- The installer (`./setup.sh`), the dashboard and the OpenAI / Anthropic compatible API.
