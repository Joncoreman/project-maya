# Maya-L - results

Maya-L (156.3 GB, `Maya-L/` on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/peasantsmith/GLM-5.3-Flash-Maya-GGUF)) is Project
Maya's largest quant of GLM-5.3-Flash: Maya-M's recipe one step up, made from Z.ai's FP8 release with Maya-M's
statistics from the FP8 model itself:

| Tensors | Type |
| --- | --- |
| routed experts' gate/up | IQ3_S, error-feedback (GPTQ-style) rounding with the FP8 model's activation statistics |
| routed experts' down | IQ4_XS; Q5_K in the most sensitive MoE layers (the first and last four) |
| attention, shared experts, dense layers | Q6_K (the KDA gates and the indexer Q8_0, the router F32) |
| the NextN (MTP) draft block | Q4_K / Q5_K experts |

The calibration text is Maya-M's, weighted toward tool calls and front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS, three.js, canvas).
Recipe: `tools/maya_quant/recipes/maya-l.json`.

## Against the FP8 model, token by token

The same 8 held-out texts (7,672 tokens) through the engine, every next-token distribution compared with the FP8
model's own:

| | KL divergence vs FP8 (lower is better) | same top token as FP8 | top-1 on the actual next token |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| FP8 | 0 | 100% | 71.5% |
| **Maya-L** (156.3 GB) | **0.188** | **90.0%** | **71.2%** |
| Maya-M (116 GB) | MAYA_M_KL | 86.2% | 70.3% |
| Maya-S (96.5 GB) | 0.428 | 83.3% | 68.8% |

## Zero-shot accuracy

**Maya-L keeps 99.2% of the full FP8 model's zero-shot accuracy**, with the same score as FP8 on HellaSwag and PIQA:

| Task (zero-shot) | FP8 | Maya-L | Recovery | Maya-M |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ARC-Easy (acc) | 87.2 | 86.0 | 98.6% | 86.5 |
| ARC-Challenge (acc norm) | 71.0 | 69.8 | 98.2% | 69.0 |
| HellaSwag (acc norm) | 88.5 | 88.5 | 100% | 86.8 |
| WinoGrande (acc) | 78.5 | 77.8 | 99.0% | 76.2 |
| PIQA (acc norm) | 87.0 | 87.0 | 100% | 85.0 |
| **Average** | **82.5** | **81.8** | **99.2%** | **80.7 (97.9%)** |

The same 400 questions per task for every model, scored the way lm-evaluation-harness scores them (the answer with
the highest log-likelihood; length-normalized where the choices differ in length) - the FP8 model run layer by layer
in PyTorch, Maya-L through Project Maya's engine (`tools/maya_quant/zs_*.py`).

## Long answers

No loops: a single-file three.js scene asked for at temperature 1.0 and greedily (greedy is where a quant loops first),
14,000 tokens each, with no repeated passage (longest repeat a single 32-token run, 0% repeated 64-token runs). Both
were still planning at 14,000 tokens - the test runs at GLM's Max thinking level.
